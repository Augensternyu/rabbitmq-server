## RabbitMQ 4.2.0

RabbitMQ 4.2.0 is a new feature release.


## Features

### Incoming and Outgoing Message Interceptors for native protocols

Incoming and outgoing messages can now be intercepted on the broker.
This works for AMQP 1.0, AMQP 0.9.1, and MQTT.

What the interceptor does is entirely up to its implementation, for example it can validate message metadata, add annotations, or perform arbitrary side effects.
Custom interceptors can be developed and integrated via [plugins](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/plugins).

Two new optional built-in interceptors were added to RabbitMQ:
1. Timestamps for outgoing messages
2. Setting client ID of publishing MQTT client

Detailed information can be found in the [Message Interceptor](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/message-interceptors) documentation.
